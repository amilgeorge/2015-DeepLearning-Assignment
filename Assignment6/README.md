Assignment 6
=============


Mini Batch K Means
------------------
Implementation of 'Mini Batch K means' clustering algorithm on cifar data set

```
usage: main_Kmeans.py [-h] [-k K] [-c C] [-t T] [-b BATCH_SIZE]
[-p PATCH_SIZE]
```

```
optional arguments:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-k K                  number of clusters
-c C                  cluster center initialization method 1. 'random', 2.
'normal'
-t T                  maximum iterations
-b BATCH_SIZE, --batch_size BATCH_SIZE
size of batch
-p PATCH_SIZE, --patch_size PATCH_SIZE
size of the patch that should be used.
```
### Output
Saves the following output files:

1. repFields.png         - Visualization of cluster centers determined through KMeans
2. clusterCount.png      - The number of samples in each cluster  




Folder Structure
=================

__/src__             - Contains all the source code

__/Observations__ - Each run creates a floder with a new timestamp and contains observations and plots generated by the run

__/data__            - Contains the folder 'cifar-10-batches-py'

All python root executables start with the name "main_*".py
